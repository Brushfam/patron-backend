Patron is created by [Brushfam](https://brushfam.io/) team as unified solution for smart 
contract verification. First, it provides developer-oriented CLI that allows to 
deploy and verify contract in one step. Patron uses [Astar network](https://astar.network/) 
for deploy. Another part of project is [Patron UI](https://patron.works/), where you can 
find smart contracts by their address or hash code and see the data of contracts.
